clear all

% the values are assigned to variables that will be used throughout the script

t = 2.5;
x = 4.3;
y = 15.25;
z = 8.2;

% the expressions below are then evaluated using the variables with the assigned values

M = 4*x^2 + 3*y + 10
N = exp(2*x) + x
O = sqrt(1/(x+y) + 1/(t+z))
P = 4*exp(-x/2)*sin(pi*x)
